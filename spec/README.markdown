Some Notes on Tests
=
If you're testing these things in your browser (as you should be), be sure to re-enter the URL
each time you build and make changes. Refreshing the page does NOT invoke any changes and
will simply make you think you've written shitty code that is somehow not working or begin 
questioning the operations of haXe. 

You, as a dev, shall NEVER question the powers of the language you're using. Whatever it is you're 
doing wrong, it is, was, and always will be your own fault. This is because you are stupid and infinitely
more worthless than the people who have written the language + compiler you're using.
